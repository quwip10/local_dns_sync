# local_dns_sync
The primary file for this project is add_and_sync.sh
Copy this file to your pihole (preferably in /etc/pihole/)
Make executable if necessary (chmod +x /etc/pihole/add_and_sync.sh)
Run with sudo (sudo /etc/pihole/add_and_sync.sh)
First time setup will add a line to your dnsmasq.d
You can then add all of your local systems and reference them by DNS.
NOTE: This requires that your router points to your pihole for DNS.
